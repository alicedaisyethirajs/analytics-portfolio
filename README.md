**Adidas sales data analysis using python** - [(https://github.com/alicedaisyethirajs/Adidas-sales-data-analytics)]

This project focuses on analyzing Adidas' sales data using Python to derive actionable insights that can enhance sales performance and inform strategic business decisions. The dataset includes detailed records of sales transactions, encompassing information such as retailer details, invoice dates, geographical locations (region, state, city), product categories, pricing, units sold, total sales, operating profit, operating margin, and sales methods. Utilizing Python's data analysis libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn within a Jupyter Notebook environment, the analysis process involved data cleaning to address missing or inconsistent entries, data transformation for structured analysis, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns. Key business objectives addressed include evaluating profit by retailer to identify top performers, monitoring sales trends over time to detect seasonal patterns, assessing product category performance to determine revenue contributors, and analyzing regional sales distribution to pinpoint high-performing areas. The culmination of this analysis is a series of visualizations and insights that provide a comprehensive understanding of sales dynamics, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.
